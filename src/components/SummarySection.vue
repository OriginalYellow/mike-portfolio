            I am a design-conscious developer who specializes in advanced UI and front-end programming. I’ve often had to dive into the more advanced aspects of UI programming with different frameworks, platforms, and languages in order to execute a designer’s vision, and I love the challenge. Having worked at a number of startups, my experience also includes roles where I’ve had to wear many different hats – project manager, data architect, product designer, UX designer, and visual designer among others. I have also dabbled in 3D graphics engine programming as a hobby. Oh, and did I mention that I love cooking?
